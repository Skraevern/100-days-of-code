# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD
# Instructions
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]
# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]

with open("file1.txt") as file:
    file1 = file.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as file:
    file2 = file.readlines()

result = [int(n) for n in file1 if n in file2]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)
